For too long the internet has been filled with unusable PNGs. 
When you inspect them in the browser they have a nice grid behind them but when you download them on your machine the grid is gone - replaced by transparency, who needs this?!

This application aims to fix that - with one simple command you can overcome the ugly transparency and get your nice and orderly grid back!
NOW EVEN WITH SUPPORT FOR HALF TRANSPARENCY!!
